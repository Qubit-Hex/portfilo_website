<section>
    <p> For my website is used a custom routing scheme in php instead of using a framework <br/>
      as i just wanted to use feature that i would need and all i needed was mailsending and 
      routing of static resources in order to minify or expand on the project with ease.
      The simplier something is the less that can go wrong. 
    </P>
